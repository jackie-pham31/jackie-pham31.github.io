This is my first project, you can see the effects by going to https://jackie-pham31.github.io

Creating a website from scatch by using HTML and CSS for a laywoman like me is not an easy task but here it is my very first draft of how my website would look like.

There would be a lot more to work on. Again, I have no background or previous experience in this area so please share (in the [issues](https://github.com/jackie-pham31/jackie-pham31.github.io/issues)) your thoughts nicely and give me some inspirations ;)
